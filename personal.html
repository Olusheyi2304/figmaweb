            <h2>Love is Wise: How Self-Work and Personal Memories Nourish Creativity</h2>
            <p>The illustrator with a creative philosophy of care discusses drawing from nostalgia, getting rid of the
                pressure to design like others, and setting better boundaries with oneself.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="personal_articles">
            <div class="notes">
                <p> When I speak with the illustrator Loveis Wise over the phone, I hear birds <br>
                    chirping in their Los Angeles garden. I also hear the pitter-patter of the <br>
                    paws of Mellow, their pet Shiba Inu, on the grass. It sounds just like the<br>
                    worlds I see when I look at Loveis’ designs—floral-filled sanctuaries<br>
                    populated by beings taking care of one another.<br><br>

                    Care, for Loveis, has become a creative philosophy of sorts: They often mine<br>
                    for inspiration childhood memories of being cared for, and their illustr-<br>
                    ations themselves embody care in their empowering depictions of intersectional<br>
                    identities, queer bodies, and self-loving individuals. Aptly, “nurture” served <br>
                    as the name and theme of Loveis’ first New Yorker cover, released two years ago <br>
                    when they were fresh out of art school at age 23 as an ode to nourishing,<br>
                    matriarchal communities.<br><br>

                    Loveis’ joyful, celebratory approach can be seen on large and small scales,<br>
                    gracing recent Black History Month mural for Google’s artist-in-residence <br>
                    program as well as a patterned bandana, designed in collaboration with Wolff<br>
                    Olins for Planned Parenthood. As with many creative people,Loveispours their<br>
                    self into their work—a process that can often best in illustrator, but also<br>
                    one that comes with its own challenges as work and life boundaries blur. Sat <br>
                    in their garden, Loveis shares the story of how taking care of themselves<br>
                    personally has led to a stronger creative outlook and working process.</p>

                <h5>The illustrator casts a wide net when looking for inspiration, drawing<br>
                    from spirituality, community and nature.
                </h5>
                <p><strong> What else inspires you, outside of art and illustration?</strong><br><br>

                    A. I’ve been learning more about spirituality, metaphysics, and playfulness,<br>
                    as well as nurturing my own community in various ways. That might mean <br>
                    making a plant medicine for a friend, cooking, or taking time to reconnect <br>
                    with my body.<br><br>



                    <strong> Q. You often draw from personal memories to create work. <br>
                        How does thatmanifest?<br><br></strong>

                    A. I started using nostalgia in my work while I was doing a lot of self-work.<br>
                    I had a rough and traumatic childhood, and to be able to move through it, I<br>
                    tried to recover calm and beautiful moments where I truly felt free. Putting<br>
                    these little memories into my illustrations has helped me a lot.

                <h4>“When you’re telling your own truth, it<br> makes for the best pieces, because people<br> will
                    connect with them.”
                </h4>
                <p>For my second New Yorker cover, I remembered moments from my childhood watching <br>
                    a femme person taking care of another femme person. My grandmother owned a hair<br>
                    salon: I drew from my memories of women coming in, getting taken care of,their <br>conversations,
                    and the beauty of that interaction. I also drew from<br>
                    memories of my mom tending to me, doing my hair, and the safety of that.</p>

                    <p> Do you ever finish a book thinking “what the heck did I just read” yet still find that you
                        enjoyed
                        it?
                        That was me with this book. I enjoyed the story, though I can’t really find the words to explain
                        why.<br><br>

                        This is definitely not a book for everyone; it’s intense yet quirky and deals with some heavy
                        topics.
